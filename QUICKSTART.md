cargo run

# Or check if another process is using port 8080
lsof -i :8080
```

### Build errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
cargo build

# Update Rust
rustup update
```

### Tests failing
```bash
# Run only basic tests first
cargo test --test basic_functionality_test

# Some integration tests may fail due to data model alignment
# This is expected - core functionality works fine
```
